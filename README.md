This is a detailed guide for setting up SDK on Windows PC for RP2040 microcontrollers.
    
## List of Softwares 
 
1. [CircuitPython 7.3.3](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_qtpy_rp2040/)
2. [PyCharm IDE 2022.2.2](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
3. [PuTTY Terminal](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
4. [ARM GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
5. [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
6. [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
7. [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
8. [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Steps

### For the Lab 1 part:

1. Follow the [intructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-2040/circuitpython) given by Adafruit team to setup CircuitPython on the PC. By the end of this we should have a drive called "CIRCUITPY" when the microcontroller is connected to the PC. This task should be pretty straight forward.

2. Instead of Mu editor we will be using PyCharm IDE for editing. Remember to turn on "Safe Write" in Settings->System Settings->Synchronization (true by default).

3. Once the sensor is connected to microcontroller using an STEMMA QT cable, refer to this [page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-apds9960-breakout/circuitpython) for sample codes to obtain proximity, color, and gesture readings.

4. We can get all the relevant librariers from this [page](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-libraries).

### For Lab 2:
